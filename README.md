# ship-trajectory-prediction-MKGRU
In adherence to data confidentiality policies, we regretfully cannot disclose ship data. Instead, we offer the Lorenz system code as a suitable alternative for the purpose of showcasing signal filtering and prediction methodologies in [demo](https://github.com/Chengfeng-Jia/ship-trajectory-prediction-MKGRU/blob/main/Kalman%20filter%20with%20GRU%20network%20driven%20dynamic.ipynb).
However, the [animation](https://github.com/Chengfeng-Jia/ship-trajectory-prediction-MKGRU/blob/main/right_one_animation.mp4) shows the real case for prediction and model selection.
